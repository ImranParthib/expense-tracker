## Expense Tracker Project Analysis

### Senior Developer Overview

This project is a full-stack expense tracker application built with an enterprise-grade backend (Flask, JWT, Docker) and a modern React frontend. It follows best practices for maintainability, scalability, and security.

#### Project Structure

```

├── app/                # Flask backend (app.py, requirements.txt)
├── frontend/           # React frontend (src/, public/, package.json)
├── docker-compose.yml  # Multi-container orchestration
├── Dockerfile          # Backend Docker build

└── dev-journey.md      # Development notes
```

**Backend:**

- Flask REST API with JWT authentication
- Service layers, validation, PostgreSQL integration
- Dockerized for production and local development

**Frontend:**

- React 18, React Router, Bootstrap 5, Axios
- Context-based authentication, protected routes, modular components

#### CSS Usage

- The project uses **Bootstrap 5** via npm and react-bootstrap for UI styling.
- No Tailwind CSS or raw CSS utility framework is used.
- Custom styles are in `App.css` and component-level CSS files.

**Recommendation:**

- For rapid prototyping and consistent design, Bootstrap is suitable.
- For highly customizable, scalable UI, consider migrating to **Tailwind CSS**.
- Avoid raw CSS for large projects; use a framework for maintainability.

#### Docker Usage

- `Dockerfile` builds the backend Flask app.
- `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates backend, frontend, and database containers.
- Enables easy local development and production deployment.

**Usage:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Best Practices

- Modular codebase, clear separation of concerns
- Environment variables for secrets/config
- Automated testing and CI/CD recommended for future
